# WDS-Sports-Network

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze sports websites to determine the best site reporting information on the NCAA National Football Championship.  Once I determined the site with the most valuable information, I began to inspect the site code and narrow down parent takes and determine if there was a pattern that I could use to consistently capture the necessary data to report on the NCAA National Football Championship.  


__Requirements for Project__
- Load data into MongoDB
- Visualize using Flask

## Resources
- Pandas
- HTML/JavaScript/BootStrap 
- Flask
- Splinter
- Beautiful Soup
- Visual Studio
- MongoDB

  
## Results
My analysis determined the best resource to scrape and report on the required information for the NCAA National Football Championship.  After scraping the information from the resource, I loaded the data into a MongoDB database.  The data was loaded into a collection that will maintain a list of dictionaries going forward.

Successfully stored mars hemisphere data in MongoDB and visualized using Flask.  This image was updated using Bootstrap.

## Summary
Although scrapting data can get a bit complex, the results were very benefical to the analyst I assisted. With web scraping and Mongo in my arsenal, I can can easily work with structed/unstructed data using most database environments in the cloud or on-prem.
