## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze sports websites to determine the best site reporting information on the NCAA National Football Championship.  Once I determined the site with the most valuable information, I began to inspect the site code and narrow down parent takes and determine if there was a pattern that I could use to consistently capture the necessary data to report on the NCAA National Football Championship.
